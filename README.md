SMIL_Player
===========

The intent of this is to create a Javascript class that will parse SMIL, particularly the [A-SMIL](http://www.a-smil.org/) variant used by [IAdea](http://www.iadea.com/technology/smil) for Digital Signage, so that a browser - I am targeting Chrome - can be a Digital Signage Player.

The player will transform the SMIL to HTML5 elements in the body of the page.
